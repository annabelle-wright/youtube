# My own version of youtube

Hello,
I have been taking part in the on demand Bright Network Virtual Internship Experience and I have really enjoyed all the webinars. I have learnt a lot and I am hugley grateful for this amazing opportunity.
The software development webinar with kathrin and Tiago was really interesting and inspired me to give the YouTube project a go.
I studied computer science at school but we only coded in Visual Basic, HTML and CSS. So, I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone and learn pyhton.
I watched a 4 hour video on the basics and followed along with the tasks before attempting the youtube project.
When I looked at the youtube project I completed the first part of the first task but then I got confused and tried for a number of hours to work out what to do.
In the end, I decied to try building my own version of youtube. I know it's not what I was meant to do- I'm sorry but I just couldn't give up!
I am working full time so I didn't have much time to work on it but I managed to complete the first part.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I understand that it's not the most efficent code as it should have more functions and modules etc.
I really enjoyed coding my own version and it has made me excicted about the opportunities at Google and in the tech industry!
Thank you :)
